# Multithreaded-web-scanner
the scanner automatically loads web pages from the internet, searches for new links on those pages, and repeats them. It simply searches for new URLs on each page, collects them, and outputs them at the end of the program. I also use Java threading so that multiple web pages can be scanned in parallel
